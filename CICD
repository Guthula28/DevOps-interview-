1. # What is CI/CD Pipeline?
A CI/CD Pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. A pipeline typically includes stages for:

Building the code
Running automated tests
Deploying to staging/production environments
Example of a basic Jenkins Pipeline:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
                sh 'npm run build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm run test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
